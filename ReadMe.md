# FocusPlant Roadmap

FocusPlant wants to achieve greater purpose to heal your well-being during your digital surfing!  

## Timers features
Timers allow us to configure an "Allow" time or "Ban time".  
Either by setting a usage counter or by fixiating hours in a day where we can use.  
E.g: We might ban harmful sites during the week and not weekend when we are more free to use.  

- Categorizing websites such as "News" or "Social media", etc... 
  Add Group to individual website and apply one configuration to all websites in the group.  
  E.g: 
  * News: Ban all week
  * SocialMedia: Ban 10pm - 12pm, 13pm - 12am, allow usage for 5 minutes per session, 1 hour per day


- Timer for website -
    * Counter timer (Allow for 3-4 minutes then ban)
      E.g: Enter Facebook.com
      Allow to be there for 3 minutes each 30 minutes.  
      Close tab if exceeds, resets only after 30 minutes.  
      * Max session time - in a single session how much can we be.
      * Total session time per day - sum of all sessions
      * Time between sessions - How much to wait for an unban.

- Export and Import configuration set-ups.  

## Positivity checks
Configure websites to be a positive influence on you,  
Educational websites, Positive sources, topics we like.  


## Gamification
Level up a plant as you use more the extension.  
Earn EXP by getting more positive content,  
or by reducing your undesired web access.  

## Typescript React extension.  
Change the codebase of this extension to be based on React so we can craft the extension more easily.
